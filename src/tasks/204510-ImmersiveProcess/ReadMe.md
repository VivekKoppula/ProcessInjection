## Notes.
1. Run the calc app. Its shown in same color as windows explorer. 
2. The calculator app is a windows run time app. 
3. The windows explorer is not a windows runtime app. But it uses some win rt apis. 
4. So IsImmersive returns true(as far as I understand).
5. So the windows explorer and calc app are shown in the same color.
